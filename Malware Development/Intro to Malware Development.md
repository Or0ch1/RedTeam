## High Level vs Low Level Languages

- High level are more abstracted from the OS, less efficient with memory and less overall control.
- Low level provide a way to interact with the OS at an intimate level and provides the dev with more freedom when interacting with the system.
## Malware Development Life Cycle

- **MDLC** consists of 5 main stages:
	- _Development_ - begin development/ refinement of functionality within malware.
	- _Testing_ - perform tests to uncover hidden bugs within the so-far developed code.
	- _Offline AV/EDR Testing_ - Run the developed malware against as many security products as possible. It's important that the testing is conducted offline to ensure no samples are sent to the security vendors. Using Microsoft Defender, this is achieved by disabling the automated sample submissions & cloud-delivered protection option.
	- _Online AV/EDR Testing_ - Run the developed malware against the security products with internet connectivity. Cloud engines are often key components in AVs/EDRs and therefore testing your malware against these components is crucial to gain more accurate results. Be cautious as this step may result in samples being sent to the security solution's cloud engine.
	- _IoC(Indicators of Compromise) Analysis_ - In this stage, you become the threat hunter or malware analyst. Analyze the malware and pull out IoCs that can potentially be used to detect or signature the malware.
	- _Return to step 1_

## Tools Needed

- Since i will be focusing on Malware development with Rust the following will be required:
	1. [[Intro to Rust#Installation| Rustrover]]
	
	2. [[Intro to Rust#Installation| Rust ]]
	
	3. [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) 
	- Debugging utility for x64 & x86 Windows Binaries allowing users to inspect and analyze state of programs and view memory contents, assembly instructions and register values. With x64dbg, users can set breakpoints, view stack and heap data, step through code, and read and write memory values.
	- The main "CPU" tab has 4 screens:
		1. Disassembly (Top-left): This window displays the assembly instructions being executed by the application.
		2. Dump (Bottom-left): This window displays the memory contents of the application being debugged.
		3. Registers (Top-right): This window displays the values of the CPU registers.
		4. Stack (Bottom-right): This window displays the contents of the stack.
	
	4.  [PE-Bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear) 
	- PE-Bear is a free, open-source tool designed to help malware analysts and reverse engineers quickly and easily analyze Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. It helps to analyze and visualize the structure of the PE file, view the imports and exports of each module, and perform static analysis to detect anomalies and possible malicious code. PE-bear also includes features such as PE header and section validation, as well as a hex editor.
	
	5. [Process Hacker 2](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php)
	- Process Hacker is an open-source tool for viewing and manipulating processes and services on Windows. It is similar to Task Manager but provides more information and advanced features. It can be used to terminate processes and services, view detailed process information and statistics, set process priorities and more. Process Hacker will be useful when analyzing running processes to view items such as loaded DLLs and memory regions.
	
	6.  Msfvenom
	- Msfvenom is a Metasploit framework standalone payload generator that allows users to generate various types of payloads.
